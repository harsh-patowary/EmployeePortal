## Key Improvements

1. **Added overflow handling to the main container**: The outer Box now has `overflow: 'auto'` to enable scrolling.

2. **Limited the height of the AttendanceList container**: The Paper component now has:
   - `flexGrow: 1` to take available space
   - `overflow: 'auto'` to enable scrolling within this container
   - `maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 250px)'` to ensure it doesn't grow too large (adjust the 250px value as needed)

3. **Used flexbox layout**: The main Box uses `display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'` to create a proper layout structure.

This approach allows:
- The header and stat cards to remain visible
- The attendance records table to scroll independently within its container
- The dialog form to appear properly as an overlay when needed

The `maxHeight` calculation ensures the table doesn't push content below the viewport, making everything fit on screen while enabling scrolling within the data table itself.
